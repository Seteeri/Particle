> The Grid. A digital frontier. I tried to picture clusters of
information as they moved through the computer. What did they look like?
 Ships? Motorcycles? Were the circuits like freeways? I kept dreaming of
  a world I thought I'd never see. And then one day . . .

Particle is a PicoLisp presentation binary tree (AST) UI.

Particle is the realization of my vision of the human computer interaction model. I want to take the extensibility, dynamicness, and cohesion of past Lisp Machines, Smalltalk-like enivronments, and others, and evolve the text interface to enable users to take advantage of the increasing digital connectedness.

Originally, this project was attempted in other languages but became only possible with PicoLisp, because *all* data is based on cons cell structures retained during runtime, which allows the interface and data to be homoiconic. For example, a C array would break this principle (for interop, they can be symbolized through a number, i.e. pointer).

One interesting implication is when characters (string data) are input via keystrokes, they exist as cons cells so there is no reading or parsing. Consequently, there is no conventional GUI as all data exists in the same domain; it is not separate from the underlying data like in conventional programs (it is possible to build a conventional GUI).

Plans are to initially support Linux and Android. Windows requires WSL or virtualization; Mac requires the latter. Once Pil21 is done (LLVM-based), a native solution can be provided. The Pinephone is also on the way ;)

The ultimate goal of Particle is to create a Lispy userland, eventually replacing the init system and encompassing all layers above that, through a more pragmatic and gradual approach.

The target audience consists of information/knowledge workers, power users, programmers.

# Preview

*UPDATE*

Can you identify the s-expression structure?

These colored text are representations for the fundamental types; the use of color allows the removal of some character tokens to optimize drawing and information efficiency.

Strings do not have double quotes; it is possible to remove other identifying tokens such as curly brackets and the dollar sign. Pairs use dot notation and terminate with the `NIL` symbol for proper lists, or arbitrary data for improper lists; parentheses are possible, for the more conservative types ;). Circular lists follow PicoLisp conventions and terminate with a dot. Lines are double-spaced to allow room for the pointer (cursor), which is no different than any other data - it is a symbol!

The hierarchial structure is a direct consequence of the underlying Lisp data, which is a graph, or more specifically a tree; manifesting in a natural UI. 

This idea is then further extended to create arbitrary representations for arbitrary data (presentation model) while maintaining the same underlying operations, or interface if you will, no matter the level of abstractions composed.

# Goals

* To achieve goals and objectives, efficiently and effectively aka "getting work done"
  * Focus: development speed > performance
  * C always exists for maximum speed/performance
* To remember everything, an extension of the human brain (Evernote/Stepan Pachikov)
* To structure a system in such a way that it can be described, explained, and understood as a whole (Oberon/Niklaus Wurth)
* To ameliorate the following sentiments: (Qix/Brad Beer)
  * "I'm tired of needing a new application for every different task."
  * "I'm tired of needing a new data format for every different task."
  * "I'm tired of not being able to connect and use my data in other applications."
  * "I'm tired of not being able to share my data with others."
  * "I'm tired of needing markup, native-code, JIT-Code, scripting languages, database languages, domain specific languages, etc..."
  * "I want to use the full power of the computer."
  * "I want the computer to meet me more than half way."

# UI

On MS and Apple systems, it serves as an outliner "app" or personal knowledge manager, however, with Linux and BSD systems it goes further absorbing the Wayland compositor, creating an encompassing Lisp environment.

*WIP*
* Local data first - no cloud dependency
* Distributable - synchronize across multiple devices
* Storage mechanisms
  * Plaintext (Lisp code)
  * Binary (Lisp data)
  * Database backend (Lisp data)
* Orthographic view aka zooming interface
* Browser integration (aka web clipper)
* Wayland/Userspace* integration
* Tag search through objects
  * Files exist for OS compatibility
* Trees
  * Undo
  * Registers
* Multiple cursors/pointers
* Import/link any data
  * Binary files such as images, video, audio etc. are not imported into the db and left as separate files
* Export data to various formats

  * What about Evernote, OneNote, Notion etc.?

  * Why PicoLisp? Dynamic scope is evil...

  * Does this roughly offer the same benefits that the old lisp machines provided?

  * Is this the same as Microsoft's OLE or Apple's OpenDoc systems which both failed?

  * Is this intentional programming?
