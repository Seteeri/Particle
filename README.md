> The Grid. A digital frontier. I tried to picture clusters of
information as they moved through the computer. What did they look like?
 Ships? Motorcycles? Were the circuits like freeways? I kept dreaming of
  a world I thought I'd never see. And then one day . . .

Particle is a PicoLisp userland.

Particle is the realization of my vision of the human computer interaction model. I want to take the extensibility, dynamicness, and cohesion of past Lisp Machines, Smalltalk enivronments, and others, and evolve the text interface to empower as many users as possible to take advantage of the increasing integration of the digital world, the ever-growing computing power, and ubiquitousness of the internet.

I believe the way for a future FOSS system does not lie solely with the desktop - that has been settled - but with the computing needs of tomorrow.

Currently, the shell is being developed. Afterwards building upon that, the window manager and PIM will be developed, which will allow interaction with existing programs, end-user functionality, and integration on other platforms.

Plans are to initially support Linux, Android, Mac. Windows requires WSL or virtualization due to POSIX requirements.

The ultimate goal of Particle is to create a Lispy userland, eventually replacing the init system and encompassing all layers above that, through a more pragmatic and gradual approach.

The target audience consists of information/knowledge workers, power users, and programmers.

* To ameliorate the following sentiments:
  * "I'm tired of needing a new application for every different task."
  * "I'm tired of needing a new data format for every different task."
  * "I'm tired of not being able to connect and use my data in other applications."
  * "I'm tired of not being able to share my data with others."
  * "I'm tired of needing markup, native-code, JIT-Code, scripting languages, database languages, domain specific languages, etc..."
  * "I want to use the full power of the computer."
  * "I want the computer to meet me more than half way."

These colored text are representations for the fundamental types; the use of color allows the removal of some character tokens to optimize drawing and information efficiency:

* Strings do not have double quotes; it is possible to remove other identifying tokens such as curly brackets and the dollar sign. 
* Pairs use dot notation and terminate with the `NIL` symbol for proper lists, or arbitrary data for improper lists
  * Parentheses are possible, for the more traditional types ;)
* Lines are double-spaced to vertically delimit pairs and to allow room for the pointer name/mode (rather than in-between pairs like conventional text cursors)
* The pointer is also a symbol!

# Goals

* To complete user tasks, efficiently and effectively ("getting $hit done")
  * In terms of programatic solutions, priority is on lowering human development and response time through adaptability/flexibility over raw performance
  * C exists where it is needed
* To remember everything, an extension of the human brain
  * Evernote by Stepan Pachikov
* To structure a system in such a way that it can be described, explained, and understood as a whole
  * Oberon OS by Niklaus Wirth at ETH ZÃ¼rich
* To optimize the planning and direction; collection; processing and exploitation; analysis and production; and dissemination of fused multi-domain information in a time-sensitive environment
  * Author's professional requirements ;)

# UI

The UI philosophy is a merger of Vim and Emacs, and to a degree Photoshop. Imagine being able to compose commands on Lisp data, instead of only strings, while getting proper state feedback/indication to reduce mode errors and enhanced discoverability to accelerate learning. The named pointers and hierarchial nature of the data allows the user to build a mental model of the system leading to faster mode prediction.

If the user must perform a search for context-related commands (rather than one they have instantly conjured up), this means the system has failed the user. In other words, the system should provide possible future directions based on the current context object at all times.

There are no overlapping or modal windows and no focus stealing.

To improve discoverability:
* System always provides mode indication and feedback at the user's locus of attention like a painting/drawing program
* Search always available and conveniently accessible like JetBrains double Shift command


*WIP*
* Keyboard-driven first
  * Mouse and touch support
  * Conventional or Vim style (modal) shortcuts
* Local/offline data first - no cloud dependency
* Database (Lisp data)
  * Persistent symbols (external symbols) - first-class data type
  * NoSQL, full ACID, replication, journaling
  * [PicoLisp DB Vs ORM](https://picolisp.com/wiki/?pilvsorm)
* Grid/Tree UI focused around lists/symbols
  * Default External Symbols (Classes/Objects):
    * +Start - REPL/DB
    * +Pointers - selection interface; key bindings/"modes"
      * +Registers - selected items (just another list)
      * +PropList - object interface
    * +Sentinel (filters input)
      * +CmdPal - context-dependent suggestions
        * +Filter
        * +Sort
        * +Search-Replace
      * +Log - undo/cmd history
        * poss modify directly - changes not log'd 
    * +Files - file navigator
      * Interfaced through symbols
      * Filepaths are translated to tags
      * "/this/is/some/path/fora/file.ext" = `(file ext this is some path fora)`
      * Each directory/word is a tag
      * Order determines priority when searching but is otherwise equivalent

  * Plain text is universal.

  * Pictographs are a poor solution; only text can represent code.
  
  * Smalltalk VMs never became mainstream.

  * Attempts at structured/projectional editors have largely failed and the ones that have succeeded are niche.

  * Does this roughly offer the same benefits that the old lisp machines provided?
